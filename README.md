# Calculator-using-python

This project implements a basic calculator GUI using Tkinter, a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. The calculator allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Python Concepts Demonstrated:

- **GUI Development:** Utilized Tkinter to create a graphical user interface for the calculator, showcasing skills in GUI development.
  
- **Event Handling:** Implemented event-driven programming to handle user interactions with buttons, such as clicking numeric keys and operators.

- **String Manipulation:** Utilized string concatenation to build the expression based on user input and evaluate mathematical expressions.

- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling using try-except blocks to catch exceptions such as zero division errors and display appropriate error messages.

- **Function Definition and Usage:** Defined functions to perform specific tasks such as updating the expression, evaluating the result, clearing the input, and handling decimal input.

## Features:

- **Numeric Buttons:** Buttons for digits 0-9 allow users to input numbers into the calculator.
  
- **Operator Buttons:** Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division enable users to perform arithmetic operations.
  
- **Equal Button:** Pressing the equal button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
  
- **Clear Button:** Clears the contents of the input field to start a new calculation.
  
- **Decimal Button:** Allows users to input decimal numbers for precise calculations.

## How to Use:

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - No additional installation is required as Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

2. **Running the Calculator:**
   - Execute the `calculator.py` file using Python.
   - The GUI calculator window will appear, ready for use.

3. **Using the Calculator:**
   - Click numeric buttons to input numbers.
   - Click operator buttons to perform arithmetic operations.
   - Press the equal button to evaluate the expression and display the result.
   - Use the clear button to reset the calculator for a new calculation.

## Skills Demonstrated:

- **GUI Development:** Developed a graphical user interface using Tkinter for creating interactive applications.
  
- **Event Handling:** Implemented event-driven programming to respond to user input and trigger appropriate actions.
  
- **Error Handling:** Used try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
  
- **Function Definition:** Defined reusable functions to encapsulate specific tasks and promote code readability and maintainability.
